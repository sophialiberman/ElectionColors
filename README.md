# ElectionColors
Will Your Color Palette Get You Elected: A data product built on a public data set of presidential election campaign colors from 1968 to present, with descriptive analysis of the colors using k-means clustering and a prescriptive algorithm to predict probability of election success based on user chosen color palette. 

Data set acquired from https://data.world/the-pudding/colors-used-in-presidential-campaign-logos-1968-2020 (with lots of thanks!)
